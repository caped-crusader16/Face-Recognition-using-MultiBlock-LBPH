# Face-Recognition-using-MultiBlock-LBPH
Local Binary Pattern Histogram (LBPH) was one of the best algorithms used to perform face recognition but in past few years, due to great ongoing researchs, there exist few more superior algorithms such as ARC Face Algo, Haar Algo, 4SF algo, etc. which are more efficient in real world terms. LBPH is an algorithm to extract the local features / patterns into histogram format. The dataset selected is 'ORL Face Dataset' which includes 10 images for each of the 40 persons. We will split the training and testing dataset into 7:3 ratio and after processing over the training dataset, we will input few images where we extract their features and find the most similar faces using nearest-neighbour classifier and thus recognition is done. For further more details, please check the report.
